# File Configuration
Requires a `.\CS490\music_player\paths.txt` file in your `user.home` directory.
This stores the directories that you want the program to (recusively) pull MP3 files out of
for use in the music player. You can edit it in the file directory itself, or modify it with `File -> Selected Directories` and adding/removing them, then clicking `Save & Close`.
